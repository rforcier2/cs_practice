# Social Media Likes:

Write a program that displays "who" liked your post.

Pattern for Displaying Likes:
If no one likes it: display nothing
If 1 person, display:   ->  [Friend's Name] Likes your post
If 2 people, display:   ->  [Friend1] and [Friend2] like your post.
If more than 2, display:->  [Friend1],[Friend2] and [#of others] Like your post

User will continuously be asked for names until the user presses enter without a name.
Depending on number of names, display a message using the above pattern
