# Speed Camera

This is a program for a very simple and trusting speed camera focused purely on the logic.
This program will ask the user to enter the speed limit.
Once set, the program asks for the speed of a car. If the user enters a value less than the speed limit, program will
display 'Ok' on the console. If the value is above the speed limit, the program should calculate the number of
demerit points. For every 5mph/hr above the speed limit, 1 demerit points will be given and displayed on
the console. If the number of demerit points is above 12, the program will display License Suspended.
