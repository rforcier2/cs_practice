# Object Demo

Two different ways to interact with Objects in C#. One with a person class where the user types in a first and last name
and is greeted. The other with a simple adding calculator that takes two numbers and returns the sum of those two numbers.
Both of these classes are in their own separate files.

The point of the exercise is to just show a basic understanding of classes, objects, and references.
